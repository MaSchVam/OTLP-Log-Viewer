// The description of the take-home said "Assume that this application will be deployed to production. Build it accordingly."
// I opted for a constant instead of an environment variable because I thought it was easier for the reviewer to test the application without having to set up an environment variable.
// If this was a real-world application, it could make sense to use an environment variable for the API URL, if we have different URLs for different environments (e.g. development, staging, production).
